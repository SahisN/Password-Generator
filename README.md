# Python-Password-Generator
Password Generator is a Python GUI based app. It allows the user to generate passwords with few options. 
Depending on what options are selected password will be different every time. This app is simple to use. Just run the main.py file and the gui will launch. 

# Generate panel and Settings panel
When you run main.py file, it will show you Generate panel where you can generate password, save password, clear generated password
and switch to settings panel

When switching to settings panel, you can choose if you want to include or exclude symbols, numbers, and capital letter. You can also choose the length of the password.
Note: If you put any crazy number like -1000 or 200 then the program will tell you the max length and won't let you exit the Settings panel.


# What different buttons do? - Generate panel
Generate button will generate the password depending on what options you selected.
Note: If you generate without changing any options then it will generate default-type of password.

Save button will open a save file gui and allow you to save the password you generate as a .txt file

Clear button will clear all the content of the text field or all the password that were generated.

Settings button will switch from generate panel to settings panel

# What different buttons do? - Settings panel
Back button will save all the settings and switch back to Generate Panel
Note: If the program throws an error than it won't switch to Generate Panel until that error is fixed.

Reset button will set every option in settings panel to default. (all boxes unchecked and length size to 10)
